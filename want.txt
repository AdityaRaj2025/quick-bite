I want to develop a web application in Japan, targeting Indian and Nepali restaurants. The app will allow customers to scan QR codes at their tables to view the menu on their phones and place orders. Orders will be linked to specific table numbers, making it seamless for the restaurant staff to deliver food.

Your plan involves starting with one restaurant to test all the functionality before offering the solution as a service to other restaurants. This ensures all features are fully tested and optimized.

The app should be:

Efficiently built with tools that allow rapid development and scalability.

Future-ready with the ability to add new features as needed.

User-friendly with a smart, intuitive interface for customers and staff.

Here is simple tought design thought, But Please you think also by your self and create good idea document for start point to endpoint.

QR Order Web App(quick-bite) (Japan) – Technical & Launch Blueprint

Audience: Indian & Nepali restaurants in JapanGoal: Let diners scan a table QR → browse menu → place orders tied to table → staff/kitchen fulfill smoothly.Approach: Build and harden with one pilot restaurant, then offer as a SaaS.

1) Product Goals & Principles

Fast to launch, easy to scale: Choose managed services, serverless where sensible.

Future‑ready: Modular domain design; feature flags; clear extension points (payments, loyalty, delivery, etc.).

Delightfully usable: Minimal taps, large touch targets, multilingual (日本語/English/ネパール語/हिन्दी).

Reliable in a busy service environment: Offline‑tolerant client, resilient backend, real‑time updates.

Restaurant‑first: Simple staff tools, printable tickets, kitchen display, order throttling during rush.

2) Core Personas & Flows (MVP)

Diner (no login): Scan QR → sees menu for that table → add items/modifiers → place order → see order status → call staff.Server/Staff: Tablet dashboard → live queue per table → send to kitchen → mark ready/served → add notes/discounts.Kitchen (KDS): Auto‑appear tickets by course/category → bump/complete.Owner/Admin: Menu editor, categories, options (spice level, size), availability toggles, printer setup, hours.

3) MVP Scope

Must‑have

Table‑linked QR deep link (no login).

Menu with categories, item options/modifiers, allergens, images.

Cart & order placement; order status.

Staff dashboard (orders by table, filters, search).

Kitchen Display System (KDS) with bump/undo, sound.

Basic printing support (cloud printing or local bridge).

Multi‑language UI (JP/EN/Nepali/Hindi) and item translations.

Taxes (Japan 10% / reduced 8%) + service charge % (optional).

Basic analytics: items sold, sales by hour, top dishes.

Role‑based access (Owner, Manager, Staff, Kitchen).

Audit logs for order lifecycle.

Nice‑to‑have (Phase 1.5)

Staff‑initiated orders (walk‑in, cash) from POS‑like screen.

Inventory countdown (86ing).

Table merge/split; move order to another table.

Course sequencing (drinks first).

Item photos uploader with auto‑resize.

Future (Phase 2+)

Online payments (Stripe JP, PayPay/LINE Pay later).

Loyalty & coupons; SMS/LINE order updates.

Multi‑venue SaaS onboarding + billing.

Integrations: Star/Epson CloudPRNT, Square/AirREGI POS sync.

Delivery/takeout, QR self‑checkout, e‑receipts.

4) Tech Stack (fast dev, scalable)

Frontend

Next.js (App Router) + React; SSR for speed + SEO (for takeout later).

TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui.

i18next (or next‑intl) for runtime translations; locale from QR or browser.

PWA: installable staff/KDS apps; offline caching of assets + menu.

Backend (pick one, both proven in your env)

Option A: NestJS (Node 20+) for rapid feature dev, class‑validator, guards.

Data & Real‑time

PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) – normalized + JSONB for flexible modifiers.

Prisma (if Node) or GORM/sqlc (if Go).

Redis for sessions, rate limits, pub/sub to KDS.

WebSockets (Socket.IO or native ws) for live order/KDS updates.

Infra/DevOps

AWS: ALB → ECS Fargate (or Lambda/API Gateway), RDS Postgres, ElastiCache Redis, S3 + CloudFront for assets, Secrets Manager.

IaC: Terraform.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions → preview deployments (Vercel for frontend optional).

Observability: OpenTelemetry → Grafana/CloudWatch; Sentry for frontend/backend.

Printing Paths (MVP → scalable)

CloudPRNT compatible printers (Star, Epson) for direct cloud tickets.

Or Local Print Bridge: small Windows/Mac mini app polling a printing queue; prints via ESC/POS/IPP to thermal printers.
